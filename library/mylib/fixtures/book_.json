He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment, where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization, and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.\r\n\r\nLondon spent almost a year in the Yukon, and his observations form much of the material for the book.

The story takes place in Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories, Canada, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush and details White Fang's journey to domestication.

White Fang examines the violent world of wild animals and the equally violent world of humans.

R. Martin. He began the first volume of the series, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011, A Dance with Dragons, took Martin six years to write. He is still writing the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter.\r\n\r\nA Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.\r\n\r\nMartin's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon.[2][3] A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.\r\n\r\nAs of August 2016, the books have sold more than 70 million copies worldwide[4] and, as of January 2017, have been translated into 47 languages.[5][6] The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller lists upon their releases.[7] Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, a TV series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.", "cover": "", "authors": [6], "genre": [7, 12, 15]}}, {"model": "mylib.book", "pk": 7, "fields": {"created_at": "2018-09-07T12:19:30.704Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-07T12:19:30.704Z", "title": "Flowers for Algernon", "year": 1966, "number_page": 311, "publishing": 5, "description": "Flowers for Algernon is a science fiction short story and subsequent novel written by Daniel Keyes.
